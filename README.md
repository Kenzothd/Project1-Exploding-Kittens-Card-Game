# Development

###### The Approach

During the development, I employed the idea of object-oriented programming. Each card in the stack is an object with a unique property that it inherits from from its parent class. The special attribute of the card will be revealed when it is played. By using this method, I can associate a specific procedure with an object, simplifying and ensuring my code remains comprehensive.
