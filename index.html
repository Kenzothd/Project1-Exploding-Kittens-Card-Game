        <h3>
          Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic, kitty-powered version of
          Russian Roulette. Basically, if you draw an Exploding Kitten, you lose
          and you are full of loser sad-sauce. All the other cards in the deck
          help you avoid or mitigate your risk of drawing an Exploding Kitten.
          If you don't explode, YOU WIN!

          <h2>The Set Up</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              1 Defuse card and 4 other cards will be dealt to each player so
              that everyone has a hand of 5 cards total. Keep your hand secret.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount of exploding kittens corresponds to the amount of
              players minus 1. For example, for a 4 player game, 3 Kittens will
              be inserted, for a 3 player game,2 Kittens will be inserted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The extra defuse cards and corresponding amount of exploding
              kittens will be shuffled with the rest of the deck and place face
              down. This is the Draw Pile.
            </li>
            <li>Player one will go first!</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="two" class="instruction-page">
          <h3>Taking your Turn</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Play a card or play a Pair from your hand by following the
              instructions on the card and clicking on it. Or play no cards at
              all; that’s cool too.
            </li>
            <li>
              After special attribute of the card is revealed, you can play more
              cards. You can play as many cards as you’d like.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the top of the Draw
              Pile into your hand by clicking the "draw" button and hoping it’s
              not an Exploding Kitten. (This is different from most other games
              in that you END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Three More Things</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The count of the cards left in the draw pile is displayed on
                  top of the drawpile.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You won’t ever run out of cards in the Draw Pile, so there’s
                  never a need to reshuffle discard cards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is no maximum or minimum hand size. If you run out of
                  cards in your hand, there’s no special action to take. Keep
                  playing. You’ll draw at least 1 more card on your next turn.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

        <div id="three" class="instruction-page">
          <h3>Card Types</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Defuse(4 Cards) -
              <span
                ><ul>
                  <li>
                    If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card
                    instead of dying. Place your Defuse card in the Discard
                    Pile.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then take the Exploding Kitten, and without reordering or
                    viewing the other cards, secretly put it back in the Draw
                    Pile anywhere you’d like.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Want to screw over the player right after you? Put the
                    Kitten right on top of the deck. If you’d like, hold the
                    deck under the table so that no one else can see where you
                    put it. Now the next player goes (unless you must take
                    multiple turns).
                  </li>
                </ul></span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Nope(2 Cards) -
              <span
                ><ul>
                  <li>
                    Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse
                    card. Imagine that any card (or Pair or Special Combo)
                    beneath a Nope card no longer exists.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can also play a Nope on another Nope to negate it and
                    create a Yup, and so on.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    You can play a Nope card at any time before an action has
                    begun, even if it’s not your turn.
                  </li>
                </ul></span
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              Exploding Kitten(1 Cards) - You must show this card immediately.
              Unless you have a Defuse card, you’re dead. Discard all of your
              cards, including the Exploding Kitten.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attack(2 Cards) - End your turn(s) without drawing and force the
              next player to take 2 turns in a row. The victim of this card
              takes a turn as normal (play cards, then draw). Then, when their
              first turn is over, it’s their turn again. (If the victim of an
              Attack card plays an Attack card, their turns are immediately
              over, and the next player must take 2 turns.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Skip(2 Cards) - Immediately end your turn without drawing a card.
              (If you play a Skip card as a defense to an Attack card, it only
              ends 1 of the 2 turns. 2 Skip cards would end both turns.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Favor(2 Cards) - Force any other player to give you 1 card from
              their hand. They choose which card to give you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shuffle(2 Cards) - Shuffle the Draw Pile thoroughly and randomly
              without viewing the cards. (Useful when you know there’s an
              Exploding Kitten coming.)
            </li>
            <li>
              See the Future(2 Cards) - Peek at the top 3 cards from the Draw
              Pile and put them back in the same order. Don’t show the cards to
              the other players.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cards with no Instructions(5 different Cards x 2 each) - These
              cards are powerless on their own, but can be played in Pairs or
              Special Combos.
