        <h3>
          Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic, kitty-powered version of
          Russian Roulette. Basically, if you draw an Exploding Kitten, you lose
          and you are full of loser sad-sauce. All the other cards in the deck
          help you avoid or mitigate your risk of drawing an Exploding Kitten.
          If you don't explode, YOU WIN!

          <h2>The Set Up</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              1 Defuse card and 4 other cards will be dealt to each player so
              that everyone has a hand of 5 cards total. Keep your hand secret.
            </li>
            <li>
              The amount of exploding kittens corresponds to the amount of
              players minus 1. For example, for a 4 player game, 3 Kittens will
              be inserted, for a 3 player game,2 Kittens will be inserted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The extra defuse cards and corresponding amount of exploding
              kittens will be shuffled with the rest of the deck and place face
              down. This is the Draw Pile.
            </li>
            <li>Player one will go first!</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div id="two" class="instruction-page">
          <h3>Taking your Turn</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Play a card or play a Pair from your hand by following the
              instructions on the card and clicking on it. Or play no cards at
              all; that’s cool too.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the special attribute of the card is revealed, you can play
              more cards. You can play as many cards as you’d like.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the top of the Draw
              Pile into your hand by clicking the "draw" button and hoping it’s
              not an Exploding Kitten. (This is different from most other games
              in that you END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Three More Things</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The count of the cards left in the draw pile is displayed on
                  top of the drawpile.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is no maximum or minimum hand size. If you run out of
                  cards in your hand, there’s no special action to take. Keep
                  playing. You’ll draw at least 1 more card on your next turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The computer have no logic hence click on "draw" and the
                  computer will draw a card to end its turn.
                </li>
              </ul>
